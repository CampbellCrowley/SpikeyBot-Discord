# Development
- Unit tests exist
  - Covers all current commands with text-only replies.
  - Tests only send a message, and check for response messages that match expected output.
    1) String exact match
    2) String contains match
    3) String does not contain match
    4) String is not an error
    5) Is an embed
    6) Correct number of messages
  - Does not work if multiple instances of bot are running.
  - Need more thorough and flexible tests.
- Linting
  - All commits are checked by eslint using Google defaults.
  - Eslint is run with pre-commit git hook.
- Most code is moved into sub-modules for easier division and reloading.
  - Music-Only mode (*needs renaming*) only loads minimal features to allow for multiple bots to run without overlap.
  - Music sub-module is expected to run in separate process to improve performance until better solution for music is made.
  - Submodules are passed in via command line arguments.
    - Path relative to cwd should be given.
    - Must be valid for directly being passed into `require()`.
- Files
  - Most persistent data is saved to disk when bot shuts down.
    - Hungry Games current state is saved and loaded. Resuming in-progress games is attempted, but untested.
      - Events and most messages are also read from file.
    - Timers and reactToAnthony settings are saved.
    - Music queues are *not* saved, but may continue playing after unloading submodule.
